# Charaterize CPU2017 Workloads

## **Abstract**
There will be (must be) quite amount of work devoted to workloads' characterization in the future. In this primitive stage of work, I collected (sampled) 10M instructions for every 250M instructions. The goal is to find portions that cause most cache misses (Loads and Stores from LLC) in order to better to stress our PCM system.

(Updating soon...)
